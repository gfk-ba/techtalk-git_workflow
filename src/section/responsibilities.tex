		When not to combine commits?
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Answer}<+->
		Having multiple commits should be the exception. It can be warranted in the following cases (non-exhaustive):
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item Very big stories, having multiple logically separate technical features.
			\item Stories having multiple completely independent sub-stories.
			\item Out-of-scope code quality improvements.

	Commit messages should be...
	\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
		\item written in clear and correct English;
		\item cover every change made in the commit;
		\item as short as possible (while not violating the above);
		\item 'tagged' if they contain out-of-scope changes;
		\item conforming to all other rules set up by the team.
	\end{itemize}
